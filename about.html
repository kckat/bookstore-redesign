		<h3> The Parnassus Story</h3>
		<p> Parnassus Books is an independent bookstore located in Nashville, Tennessee. Co-owned by bestselling author Ann Patchett and publishing veteran Karen Hayes, Parnassus stocks the best selections of literature, non-fiction, childrenâ€™s, local interests, and the arts. The store also boasts an extensive local author section.</p>

		<p>In Greek mythology, Mount Parnassus was the home of literature, learning, and music. We are Nashville's Parnassus, providing a refuge for Nashvillians of all ages who share in our love of the written word. We provide a venue for writers to connect with readers, and for readers to connect with books. In doing so, we strive to complement and contribute to the rich cultural character of Nashville, the Athens of the South.</p>

		<h3> Our History</h3>
		<p> Parnassus Books opened in November 2011. You may have seen a story or two about it in the news (Novelist Fights the Tide by Opening a Bookstore - The New York Times ; "It's a Gift I Want to Give the City I Love" - Chapter16 | Humanities Tennessee; Why It's Important for Communities to Have Bookstores - Marketplace; Ann Patchett on New Chapter for Independent Bookstores - BBC News; Author Ann Patchett Opens Own Indie Bookstore - NPR).</p>

		<p>Perhaps no one tells the story of Parnassus quite as well as Ann Patchett herself (Owning a Bookstore Means You Always Get to Tell People What To Read - The Washington Post). Here's an excerpt from "The Bookstore Strikes Back" chapter of Ann's memoir, This Is the Story of a Happy Marriage.
